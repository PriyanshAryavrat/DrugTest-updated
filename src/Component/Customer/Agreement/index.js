          With my signature, 1 hereby agree to participate in the Accurate C&amp;S Services (Service Agent),
          consortium which operates in accordance to 49 CFR Parts 40.1 further agree to abide by the Service Agent
          rules, policies and procedures including testing, notification, enrollment and removal instructions of the
          Service Agent. Upon receipt of my signed application and applicable fees, the Service Agent, will forward me a complete
          membership package. If my covered employees have not been enrolled in a random testing pool, they will submit to a
          pre-employment test as required by 49 CFR Part 40 regulations. If I am an owner-operator company or company owner,
          I agree to submit and have all driver(s) submit to a pre-employment test and random testing will
          selected. I agree that the Service Agent will contract with a DHHS certified laboratory,
          MRO &amp; collection sites on my company's behalf and authorize them to receive all test results from the
          MRO. As supervisor, I agree to inform the Service Agent of address and phone number changes and current
          employee status via employee ADD/DELETE Employee forms enclosed in the welcome packet. Non-compliance may result in an
          administration fee or removal from the consortium, PLEASE REMEMBER THAT it is important to inform us of email, mailing
          address and telephone number changes to ensure you receive all random selection notifications because "no-shows" are
          considered a Refusal to Test which is a positive drug test result. As an employee or driver, I authorize the release of my drug
          test results to my company supervisor or designee and/or DOT agent and/or the CPUC.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>ENROLLMENT:</strong> Enrollment includes: Pre-Employment Urine Screen, Company Certificate of
          Enrollment, Company Policy, Employee Educational Materials, Random Pool Enrollment, Laboratory Summary
          Reports and MIS Reports, upon request, a list of Substance Abuse Professional (SAP) will be referred for
          an employee who violates the drug and alcohol testing Regulations by testing positive or not appearing
          for a random selection test, if employee is not terminated after a positive urine screen. The SAP will
          determine the number of return-to-duty and follow-up testing requirements for such employees.
          As supervisor, I agree to maintain all SAP reports and evaluations and notifying the Service Agent of
          all required testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>POST ACCIDENTS: </strong> 
          As Supervisor, I agree to notify the Service Agent to perform a drug and alcohol test when an employee
          is involved in an accident that results in a human fatality; citation AND bodily injury requiring
          medical attention away from accident scene or disabling damage to any vehicle requiring tow away. Breath
          alcohol testing must occur within 2 hours following an accident but no later than 8 hours. Drug testing
          must occur immediately but no later than 32 hours following an accident.
          Upon notification of random selection, as supervisor/owner I will ensure each driver selected for random
          testing is notified and receives testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Non-compliance may result in removal from the program. ! (driver) may be discharged or otherwise
          disciplined for any violation by me of said Anti Drug and Alcohol Abuse Policy, for any failure or refusal to
          provide urine specimens when requested by Accurate C&amp;S Services. Refusal to Test includes, but are not limited to,
          No-show (failure to appear at the test collection site for random, post-accident,
          return-to-duty and follow-up testing); Failure to remain at the testing site until the collection is
          completed; Adulteration (urine specimen containing a substance or a concentration of a substance inconsistent with human urine);
          Substitution (urine specimen containing creatinine and specific gravity levels inconsistent with human urine);
          Failure to cooperate with any part of the testing process; e.g., not responding to random selections and disputing the process.
          I further understand that I must submit to direct observation testing if a specimen test is reported as
          Invalid or Negative Dilute with a creatinine &gt;2mg/dL but &lt; 5mg/dL, per MRO request, or per collector's request due to
          temp. out of range, etc. I further agree that the Service Agent may notify the CPUC, Employer, DOT and/or the
          California Highway Patrol of any non-compliance and removal from the consortium.

          <strong>SUPERVISOR TRAINING: </strong> 
          Reasonable Suspicion training for supervisors is required. The company needs to have an individual
          trained in physical, behavioral, speech and performance indicators of probable alcohol misuse and
          use of a controlled substance. The purpose of this training is to enable supervisors to determine
          whether reasonable suspicion exists to require a driver to undergo testing. Supervisor training is
          $75.00 per Supervisor.
